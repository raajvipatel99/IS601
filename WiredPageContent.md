## Wired and Wireless Data transmission

- Internet is a system that ships binary information, 0 an (off) and 1 (on). It has two states and hence called binary code. But the 0’s and 1’s not physically sent.
- Bits are physically sent through 3 ways including Wired and Wireless Data Transmissions:
- Electricity – Data transmission is done through an electric bulb where on is 1 and off is 0. Timer is introduced to know continuous zeros or ones (1 bit per sec). To make it faster bandwidth is increased. Bandwidth is measured in bitrate – number of bits sent over a given period of time. Data transmission through ethernet wires leads to signal loss.
- Light – Data transmission is done through an optical fiber which transmits data by light to a receiving end, where the light signal is decoded as data. This type of data transmission is used to send bits to long distances with minimal signal loss.
- Radio Waves – Data is transferred through wireless medium where 0 and 1 converted into radio waves of different frequencies. Radio signal cannot travel long so information is first sent through wireless router and then transferred to physical wire to travel long distances.
- Physical ways of communication may change but underlying binary representation and protocols remain the same.
