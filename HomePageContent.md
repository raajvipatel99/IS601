- Internet in a Nut Shell
 ## What is Internet?
- A global computer network providing a diversity of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols
- Made up of large number of independently created networks that are fully distributed, has no central control and focuses on end-to-end connectivity.
- How, When and Where was it created?
- Seminal idea behind the internet was envisioned by psychologist J.C.R. Licklider, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1950’s.
- Licklider’s vision was that computers will allow to communicate and connect all the computers together providing better sharing of information among people. The first computers were very large and expensive and were never intended to communicate, and they would have remained that way if ARPA wasn’t created.
- To catch up with Soviet Union’s Sputnik, ARPA was created on February 7, 1958, by President Dwight Eisenhower that ultimately led to creation of ARPANET on 21st November 1969 that evolved into internet. The full form of ARPA is Advanced Research Projects Agency.
