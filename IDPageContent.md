## IP address and DNS

- Until 1970, there was no standard communication method. Later Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn laid a groundwork for internet by inventing IP address. 
- An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
- There are two types of IP address: 
- IPV4 – IPV4 is 32 bit long, 8 bits for each of the 4 parts (IP components) - country network / regional network / subnetwork / device address. It provides 4 billion addresses.
- IPV6 – IPV6 is 128 bits written as hexadecimal numbers organized in eight blocks of 16 bits each separated by colons and it provides 340 undecillion unique addresses.
- DNS (Domain Name System) was invented by Paul Mockapetris in 1983. 
- Its main purpose is to associate names with corresponding address (host name configuration). 
- Whenever your computer makes a request to a website, the request first goes to DNS server where it converts the name of the website to its relevant IP address and then ents the request to it.
- DNS servers are divided into hierarchy and zones and splits responsibility for major domains like .org, .com, .net
- DNS was originally created for public communication and It is prone to attacks like (DNS) spoofing where DNS server is hacked and changed to match a domain name with wrong IP address.
- DNS, IP are designed to be scalable no matter how large internet grows.
