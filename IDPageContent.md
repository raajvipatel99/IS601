## IP address and DNS

Until 1970, there was no standard communication method. Later Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn laid a groundwork for internet by inventing IP address.\
There are two types of IP address: \
IPV4 – IPV4 is 32 bit long, 8 bits for each of the 4 parts - country network / regional network / subnetwork / device address. It provides 4 billion addresses.\
IPV6 – IPV6 is 128 bits written as hexadecimal numbers organized in eight blocks of 16 bits each separated by colons and it provides 340 
undecillion unique addresses.\
DNS (Domain Name System) was invented by Paul Mockapetris in 1983. Its main purpose is to associate names with corresponding address.\
Whenever your computer makes a request to a website, the request first goes to DNS server where it converts the name of the website to its relevant IP address and then ents the request to it.\
DNS servers are divided into hierarchy and zones and splits responsibility for major domains like .org, .com, .net\
DNS was originally created for public communication and It is prone to attacks like spoofing where DNS server is hacked and changed to match a domain name with wrong IP address.\
DNS, IP are designed to be scalable no matter how large internet grows.
