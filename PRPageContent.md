## Packets, Routing and Reliability

- How is it possible for every piece of astonishing amount of data to be delivered to you reliably ?
- Information when transferred through network, does not follow a dedicated path. 
- It is broken down into pieces, called packets. Each packet has a source and destination address in its header and depending on the traffic congestion, it takes a different path in the network. 
- This method of breaking down of information into packets and sending them independently though the optimum path is known as packet switching.
- Router acts like a network traffic manager. It keeps track of multiple paths and chooses the cheapest (in terms of time, company relationships and politics) path for a packet to travel. 
- More options for path makes network fault tolerant. Router systems, TCP are designed to be scalable.
- Reliability is the key principle for internet. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) guarantees that all the data is delivered by sending (TCP) acknowledgements for each packet received. 
- If acknowledgement for a packet isnâ€™t received after some time, that packet is resent, thereby leading to reliable data transfer.
- Principles of Fault Tolerance and Redundancy state that more routers lead to more reliability.
