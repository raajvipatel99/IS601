## Encryption and Public Keys

- We share private information over shared connections. 
- How is secure data kept safe ? 
- Public key cryptography is the foundation of secure messaging. 
- One of the well known methods is Caesar Cipher (found by Julius Caesar) where algorithms are created that substitute each letter in the original message with a letter which is a certain number of steps down the alphabet (the caesar shift).
- Encryption also known as codification is simply scrambling of original text to hide it while Decryption also known as decodification is descrambling into readable format.
- This is done using key which is known only by the sender and the receiver. 
- However, it is easy to crack by mere guessing or trying out the 26 possible alphabets. 
- In order to make it more difficult, each letter is substituted with different amount but that could also be solved by computer power. 
- Hence, encryption is done using 256-bit keys. As the length of key increases, the number of possible guesses exponentially increases.
- There are 2 types of keys:
- Symmetric Key where the sender and the receiver share a same key. Meaning there is only one key both to unlock and lock the message.
- Another type is an asymmetric key (asymmetric encryption) where you need a  public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt data. 
- Public key as the name suggests, is shared with everyone while private key is not shared.
- Public key cryptography is the foundation of all secure messaging on open internet.
